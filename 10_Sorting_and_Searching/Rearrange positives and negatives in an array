Given an array containing both positive and negative numbers, sort the array in such a way that the negatives are moved to the front of the array and the positives are moved to the end of the array. Also maintain the order of the numbers. 

Example:
input : {-4,-8,1,11,-6,7,5,-2,1,6}
output : {-4 ,-8, -6, -2, 1, 11, 7, 5, 1, 6}
